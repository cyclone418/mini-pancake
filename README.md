## Experience

- previously web2 dev (fullstack and computer vision AI).
- joined the space during ohm fork season. First public project was a community driven Concave NFT launch with fellow anons. Concave founders reached out shortly after the launch to extend invitation to join core team.

## Jobs

- Concave

  - main contributor for LiquidStaking and GemSwap AMM contracts. Also involved in AccrualBonding contracts with another dev.
  - worked on web dev at later stage after front end devs failed to meet deadline and needed more help, specifically staking page and marketplace page. (https://app.concave.lol/)

- Jones

  - joined early Jan as founding dev, fourth member of the team after icecream, ultra and xen.
  - main contributor for jones dapp. Created all pages pre-launch, helped by another dev from DopexNFT who was picking up react and typescript during that time. (https://app.jonesdao.io/)
  - only contributor for jones landing page. (https://www.jonesdao.io/)
  - no major contribution in contract, web development was the part that was falling way behind pre-launch. Post launch the team managed to hire a few more solidity devs to help out.

- DSquared
  - co-worker from jones is one of the founders, mostly jumping in as needed on a part-time basis to help resolve blockers before the team can find experienced devs that can commit full time.
