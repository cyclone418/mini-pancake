              JonesDAO employs strategies across a broad range of markets. The
              available liquidity in said markets changes constantly. As a
              result, JonesDAO cannot calculate APYs in real time. Users
              acknowledge this and also acknowledge the risk of negative returns
              on their deposited funds during certain time periods. By
              depositing funds in JonesDAOâ€™s vaults, the user assumes any
              associated risk of loss.
